# MCP Shell Access

A secure shell access implementation using Model Context Protocol (MCP). This project provides a controlled environment for executing shell commands through MCP, with a focus on security and containerization.

## Overview

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides secure, restricted shell access within a Docker container. It's designed to allow AI agents to interact with a shell environment in a controlled and safe manner.

## Features

- Secure shell command execution through MCP
- Docker containerization for isolated environments
- Restricted command set with configurable permissions
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Built using official MCP SDKs
